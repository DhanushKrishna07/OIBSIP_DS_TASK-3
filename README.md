This is task 3 of Oasis Infobyte | Data Science Domain.

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.

ðŸš—Car Price Prediction with Machine LearningðŸ’°

Exploring and predicting car selling prices through comprehensive data analysis and machine learning techniques.

Project Highlights:

â€¢Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on car dataset.
â€¢Visualized distributions and correlations of key numerical features.
â€¢Applied one-hot encoding to handle categorical variables.
â€¢Built and evaluated a Linear Regression model to predict car selling prices.
â€¢Achieved insightful predictions with model performance metrics.

Steps Involved:

â€¢Imported necessary libraries and loaded the dataset.
â€¢Analyzed dataset structure, missing values, and data types.
â€¢Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions.
â€¢Plotted histograms for numerical features like "Year", "Selling_Price", "Present_Price", and "Driven_kms".
â€¢Created a heatmap to visualize correlations between numerical features.
â€¢Generated scatter plots to examine relationships between features and target variable.
â€¢Applied one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables into numerical format.
â€¢Split the dataset into features ("X") and target variable ("y").
â€¢Split the data into training and testing sets.
â€¢Built a Linear Regression model and trained it using the training data.
â€¢Predicted car selling prices for both training and testing sets.
â€¢Evaluated model performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) scores.
â€¢Visualized the predicted vs actual car selling prices.

Key Takeaway:

ðŸ”‘By leveraging Linear Regression and exploratory data analysis, we can effectively predict car selling prices, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in the automotive market. This project demonstrates the importance of thorough data preprocessing and visualization in building accurate predictive models.ðŸ’¡
